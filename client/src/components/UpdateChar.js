          Before choosing a name for your character take a second to think about
          the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous
          fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard.
          Pick a name that will exemplify and amplify the individual feature of
          you fantastic persona.

        <p>
          Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent
          humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player character
          races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. The race you choose
          contribute in an important way, by establishing a general appearance
          and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry.

          Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes the
          character's vocation, what special talents they possess, and the
          tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon,
          fighting monsters, or engaging in tense negotiation.

        <p>
          Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six
          abilities. Each ability has a score, which is the number you will
          record on your character form. You may use the roll dice feature of
          this app to generate the six numbers you need to input into your
          character sheet. You may switch around the numbers after filling it
          out a first time. If you are uncomfortable with randomly generating
          these scores you can use the following scores instead:
          15,14,13,12,10,8
        </p>

        <p>
          Your character's background describes where they come from, their
          original occupation, and your character's place in the D&D world. Talk
          with your Dungeon Master while building your background and they will
          be able to offer guidance. A background that fits within the campaign
          is always a more enjoyable expirience for whole party.

          those items.

        <p>
          The hit points you have at the beginning of the game are dependant on
          your class. Enter those hit points here. Don't worry about it being a
